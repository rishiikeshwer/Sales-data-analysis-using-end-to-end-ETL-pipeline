Data Extraction - Kaggle API 

Data Transformation - Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Data Loading/ insights - Microsoft SQL Server



The order sales data is extracted from Kaggle API inside Jupyter Notebook and data transformation is performed.

# Data Transformation in Python

Transformations like removing Not Available values and creating new records such as profit, sale_price, and discount are designed to facilitate further data analysis.

The transformed data is then connected to a Microsoft SQL server through "sqlalchemy" by creating a table to draw insights.
